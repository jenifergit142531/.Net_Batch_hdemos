- Event
- Event Listener
- Arrow functions
- ES 6 Features
- JS Promises
- Async and Await

Event :

- some actions performed by the user / browser
- Changes in the state of the object => Event (definition)

Event handling :

- process of responding to the event is event handling 

events :

click
mouseover
focus
keydown
keyup
double click
onload
onresize

Event Listener :

- it is used to attach the event handler with the method.

Arrow function :

=>

left side (inputs) => right side (expression)

eg :

item => item %2==0


Javascript Callbacks :

" I will call back later "

- a call back is a function that is passed as argument to another function

Promises :

" I PROMISE A RESULT"

Producer - produce the code 
Consumer -  waits for the result

Promise is an object that links the request and response

Promise object properties :

State                           result
"Pending"                       undefined
"fulfilled"                     result 
"rejected"                      error

XMLHTTPREQUEST : Object is used to request the data from the server 
- Built in object 

Async and Await :

Async = makes a function to return a promise
Await = wait for the promise


ES 6 Features :

ECMA SCRIPT  - Language specification standard

class and object 
arrow function
Promises
multiline string

var x="jlj"
ES6 var x = `hkoljfeglo;rk
ugkheglj`

Literals

${obj.variable}

Enhanced object literal : passing values to method 

display("hello")
