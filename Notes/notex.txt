MVC - Model - View - Controllers

Design pattern :

Model : It will contain data and data logic
View : Render the web page on the browser
Controller : Contains logic(action methods)..Interact with model and view.


Architecture of MVC vs Core MVC :

Request Life cycle model :(MVC)

HTTP Request ---> Routing(route handler)----> Controller ---->Action execution
---->Rendered as view ---->HTTP Response


Request life cycle model : (Core mvc)

HTTP Request ---> Middleware (s/w component)-->Routing--->Controller --->action execution
--->Render view(Result execution)--->HTTP Response

Creating Web application :

dotnet new mvc -o MvcMovie

Controller :

- Handles the user action(logic)
- Render a view 
- Strictly create the controller only inside the controller folder
- Controller name should begin with capital letter
- suffix with controller keyword
- contains many action methods

Action Methods :

- methods must be defined only inside the controller
- should perform logic
- all the action methods MUST BE PUBLIC
- [ActionName("somename")] - current active action method
- [NonAction] - Not active anymore,not executed
- HTTP Verbs [get,post,put,delete]

Read - get : select
create - post : insert
Update - put : update
Delete - delete : delete


Action methods with parameters :
