Agenda :

- Multithreading
-> concurrency
--> Asynchronous programming(Async/Await)


Background thread 

- when main thread stops execution, the child thread also stops the execution

Foreground thread

- Even if the main thread stops,child thread will keep executing

Concurrency :

DoinG several trhings at the same time.

Task parallel library  :TPL

- only do the parallel processing 

3 syntax :

1. Task tobj=new Task();

2.Task tobj = Task.Run() =>
{
//some task code goes gere
}

3.Task tobj=Task.Factory.StartNew();

Async : Asynchrounously
Await :wait for specified period of time

TPL Library :

- Set of predefined methods and constructs for implementaing data and task parallelism.


1.Data Parallelism :

-> Parallel FOR
-> Parallel For Each

2.Task Parallelism
-> Parallel.Invoke(m1,m2,m3)
